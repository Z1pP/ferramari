# Changelog

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-30

Reliability and recovery.

- Detect an unexpected mpv exit and recreate the player with a capped
  exponential backoff. After five retries the automatic loop stops instead of
  spawning processes forever.
- Kill and reap wedged external commands (`mpv`, `ffprobe`, `ffmpeg`,
  `xdg-user-dir`, Flatpak `gsettings`) at a hard deadline.
- Report WebKit load failures, retry the page once and show one clear error.
- Generate static-wallpaper frames on a worker thread so ffmpeg no longer
  blocks the GTK main loop.
- Write `config.json` atomically and keep `config.json.bak`; recover from a
  truncated or invalid primary file.
- Add monitor reattachment and scaling tests, structured user errors, locked
  CI builds, metadata and translation validation, a RustSec audit and a
  tag-driven release workflow.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-29

- Russian interface and a language selector (System, English, Russian,
  Japanese).
- Russian plural forms through gettext.
- Translated tray menu.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-29

- Live wallpaper catalogue with categories, search and pagination.
- Still preview, six-frame sheet, download progress, cache management and
  install through the monitor menu.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-26

- First release: local video, streaming, web-page wallpapers, multi-monitor,
  GNOME static wallpaper, tray, D-Bus and autostart.
